   - `requirements.txt` (from requirements_complete.txt)
   - `Procfile` (from Procfile_complete)
   - `Dockerfile` (from Dockerfile_complete)
   - All your templates and supporting files
3. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
4. Deploy automatically

#### For ZIP Upload:
1. Create a folder with all necessary files
2. Upload as ZIP to Railway
3. Configure build settings

## 📁 Required Files for Deployment

### Core Files (Required):
