# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for GoldGPT

## Quick Deploy to Railway

Your GoldGPT application is now ready for Railway deployment! Follow these steps:

### 1. Deploy from GitHub

1. **Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Connect your GitHub account**
3. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select your repository**: `Kenan3477/QuantGoldGPT`
5. **Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app**

### 2. Add Database

1. In Railway Dashboard: **New â†’ Database â†’ PostgreSQL**
2. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Your app will automatically connect to PostgreSQL in production

### 3. Set Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables tab, add:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
FLASK_ENV=production
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-alpha-vantage-key
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your-finnhub-key
POLYGON_API_KEY=your-polygon-key
ENABLE_REAL_TRADING=False
ENABLE_ADVANCED_AI=True
ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=True
JWT_SECRET_KEY=another-super-secret-jwt-key
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 4. Get Your API Keys

- **Alpha Vantage**: [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) (Free)
- **Finnhub**: [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/) (Free tier available)
- **Polygon**: [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) (Free tier available)

### 5. Deploy!

1. **Railway automatically deploys** when you push to main branch
2. **Monitor logs** in Railway Dashboard
3. **Access your app** via the Railway-provided URL

## Railway Configuration Files Included

- âœ… `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- âœ… `Procfile` - Process file for deployment
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (Railway-optimized)
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Git ignore file
- âœ… `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Automatic Features

- **Auto-scaling**: Railway scales based on usage
- **SSL Certificate**: Automatic HTTPS
- **Environment Detection**: App adapts to production/development
- **Database Backups**: Automatic PostgreSQL backups
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and metrics

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the application**: Visit your Railway URL
2. **Check ML predictions**: Navigate to `/ml-predictions-dashboard`
3. **Monitor logs**: Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Logs
4. **Custom domain** (optional): Railway Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is added and `DATABASE_URL` is set
2. **API Keys**: Verify all API keys are correctly set in environment variables
3. **Port Binding**: App automatically uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
4. **Build Errors**: Check Railway logs for Python dependency issues
