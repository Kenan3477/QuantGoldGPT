EMERGENCY RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
=========================================
Date: August 7, 2025

CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED TO RAILWAY:

1. âœ… Fixed ML Prediction Logic (app.py)
   - Direction now matches price targets logically
   - "bullish" = positive change, higher target
   - "bearish" = negative change, lower target

2. âœ… Enhanced Frontend (critical-fixes.js)
   - Proper data display handling
   - Fixed navigation system
   - Real-time prediction updates

3. âœ… API Debug Endpoints Added
   - /api/debug/predictions for testing
   - Better error handling

RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- Git commit: e4d9f81
- Files changed: 5 files, 1434 insertions
- Push status: SUCCESS âœ…

NEXT STEPS FOR RAILWAY APP:
1. Railway auto-deployment should complete in 2-3 minutes
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
3. Check: https://web-production-41882.up.railway.app/
4. Test navigation by clicking sidebar buttons
5. Verify predictions show real data instead of "--"

EMERGENCY TEST ENDPOINTS (Railway):
- Main API: https://web-production-41882.up.railway.app/api/ml-predictions/XAUUSD
- Debug API: https://web-production-41882.up.railway.app/api/debug/predictions
- Test page: https://web-production-41882.up.railway.app/test-predictions
