🔧 INTEGRATED SYSTEMS:
   - Flask API endpoints for signal generation
   - SQLite database for signal tracking
   - Real-time WebSocket updates
   - Background tracking processes

🌐 API ENDPOINTS ADDED:
   - GET /api/generate-signal - Generate new trading signal
   - GET /api/active-signals - Get all active signals
   - GET /api/signal-stats - Performance statistics

   Advanced signals table with 25+ fields including:
   - Signal metadata (ID, type, timestamps)
   - Price data (entry, TP, SL, risk-reward)
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, BB position)
   - Market context (sentiment, volatility)
   - Learning data (reasoning, accuracy factors)

SIGNAL GENERATION PROCESS
=========================

1. 📡 REAL DATA FETCHING
   - Fetches 30 days of hourly gold price data
   - Current price: ~$3,340 (live from multiple sources)
   - 569 data points processed per signal

2. 🔍 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

   - MACD: Trend momentum confirmation
   - Bollinger Bands: Price position analysis
   - Support/Resistance: Dynamic level calculation
   - Volume: Confirmation strength
   - Momentum: Rate of change analysis

3. 🎯 SIGNAL DECISION
   - Minimum 0.35 signal strength threshold
   - Multiple factor confirmation required
   - BUY signals: Strong bullish confluence
   - SELL signals: Strong bearish confluence
   - NO SIGNAL: When conditions don't meet threshold

4. 💰 TARGET CALCULATION
   - Entry: Current market price
   - Take Profit: 1.5-5% based on volatility
   - Stop Loss: 0.8-2.5% based on volatility
   - Adjustments for support/resistance levels

5. 🔄 TRACKING & LEARNING
   - 60-second price monitoring
   - Automatic outcome detection
   - Performance statistics update
   - ML model retraining with new data

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
========================

🎲 WIN RATE TARGET: 65-75%
